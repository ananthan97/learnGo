/*
	Whitespaces in Go
		Whitespaces are characters that create space in the code but do not produce any visible marks.
		They include spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
		Whitespaces are used to separate tokens in the code, making it more readable and organized.
		Go is designed to be flexible with whitespaces, allowing developers to format their code in a way that enhances clarity.
		However, excessive or inconsistent use of whitespaces can lead to confusion, so it's important to use them judiciously.

		var age int; // Correct usage with a single space between 'var', 'age' and 'int'
		var    age    int; // Excessive spaces, still valid but less readable
		fruit = apples + oranges; // Correct usage with spaces around the '+' operator
		fruit=apples+oranges; // No spaces, valid but less readable
